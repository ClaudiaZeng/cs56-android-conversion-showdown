Hello! This is the beginning of a new Legacy Project for CS56 at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Project Description: An Android Application.

Authors: Henry Yu, Phillip Fry Date: Winter 2016

Professor: Phil Conrad
Mentor: Allie Shedden

Progress and Point Breakdown:

Downloaded Android Studio. Familiarized with Java files vs. XML files.

Configured Android Manifest file. Familiarized with Layouts, Listeners, Widgets, etc.

Created 3 Activities: 
  
  1) Welcome Screen in which it prompts the user to enter their name. After pressing enter, their name will show up as a welcome message. There is a button that directs the user to the next screen.
  
  2) Calculator Screen in which it is a simple calculator application with Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division. There is a button that directs the user to the next screen.
  
  3) Quiz Intro Screen that prompts the user for what they would like to be quizzed on.
        We still need to figure out how to make sure the display looks the same on different devices. On smaller screen simulators 
        there is some overlap in the text. It works on an andorid device properly (HTC ONE M8).
        
  4) Quiz Activity which tests the users knowledge of numeric conversions (still in progress, only does Decimal to Binary)
