a) The project is a converted java program to an android application. The application is a quiz application that tests the users ability to convert from different number bases (hex, dec, bi, oct). A simple decimal based calculator is also provided.

b) As a user, I can enter my name and I am prompted with a welcome message so that it feels personalized. I can begin the quiz and am shown my results at the end so I am informed of how well I did. I can use the calculator to do the provided operations (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) so that I can verify my math. I can use the converter to convert from decimal to binary so I can easily do conversions.

c)The android application is functioning. It took some time to debug android studio but it is now working. I am able to enter my name and get a welcome messsage, I can use the built-in calculator, I can use the converter, and I can choose the quiz type/difficulty I want to test my skills.

d) As a user, I would like to have access to a calculator that calculates in different number bases so that I can check my work as I solve these problems on paper. As a user, I can appreciate a splash screen so that I can have a more enhanced experience. As

e) The README was very clear and laid out well. There were some spelling and grammar mistakes that can be fixed. The provided pictures were very helpful and the final remarks were very detailed and did a very good job of passing on the code.

f) Since this is an android application, there is no provided build.xml for this project.

g) There are enough issues to work up to 1000 points on the project. Our mentor also mentioned that since we do not have android development experience, there will be added point possibilities on learning how to code and work with android studio. The provided issues are very short so we may need some clarification on what exactly is wanted.

h) There are no additional issues to be added at the moment therefore there are no links to provide.

i) The code is well organized. The methods are clear as well as with the naming convention used. It is self-explanatory. In the parts that are more difficult to understand, I think commenting more would be beneficial for those who are unfamiliar with the code. As of right now, I don't understand a lot of what a lot of these classes are exactly for or what they are intended to do. As someone who is about to tackle this project without much knowledge of how the code works yet, I would like to be provided the Quiz.java file that holds a huge portion of what the application does. It contains a lot of comments for what each line of code does. I think this is very helpful and is a practice that I would like to continue so others can easily understand what is happening.

j) There are JUnit tests. There is not many test cases in the tests itself and that is something that can be improved. There are many opportunities to improve the tests for this application. We can tests numerous conversions from different base types to different base types. We can tests the calculator for a vast amount of calculations. We can tests the quizing to see if the correct results are showing.
