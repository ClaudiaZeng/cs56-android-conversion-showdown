##lab02 Descriptions

a. Project Description: An android app to do calculation based on different bases (binary, oct, hex, etc) and give a quiz.

b. There is a welcome interface. After that there's an activity which allows users to set their names. Then users can calculate or have a quiz in the next activity.

c. It runs well, but android studio modified gradle automatically to build it and overwrite paths( was Philip's path ). It gives a test about bin, oct and hex conversion.

d. Sometimes keyboard does not disappear as I expect. Users may need different difficulty levels. User interface can be better. Web backend can be developed.

e. android API version, gradle version. Original readme contains a lot of useful information.

f. No. Android studio uses gradle. I assume they used default gradle settings and followed the general conventions of Android based on their codes.

g. I think I can obtain 1000 points on this project. 

h.

i. There are 6 activities. Introduction is just an activity with a neat pattern and a button for entering welcome interface. Welcome activity allows users to set names. After setting names, users enter a Calculator activity where they can do operations on decimal numbers. Also there is a button in the Calculator activity which allows users to start a quiz( enter QuizSelection activty). In quiz selection activty, users can choose options for the quiz. After clicking a button, users finlally enter a Quiz activty and start their quiz. Aftere quiz or clicking abort button in quiz activity, users enter ScoreReport activty, get their scores and choose to back to calculator or QuizSelection activity.



j. No test at all, from my perspective. Fortunately, android studio's style allow me to add tests. The code quality is not very high but at least readable. Some implementations are not crystal clear and some names of variables and resources are not reusable.
